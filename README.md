# About

The contents of this repository are my solutions to the assignments in [Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). 

The projects are:
1. Bike sharing patterns analysis with a simple neural network (with a single hidden layer) written in NumPy,
2. Dog breed classifier implemented as a Convolutional Neural Network in PyTorch,
3. TV Script generation implemented as a Recurrent Neural Network in PyTorch,
4. Face generation implemented as a Generative Adversarial Network in PyTorch,
5. Sentiment Analysis RNN implemented in PyTorch with a deployment to AWS SageMaker.

In each folder there is a Jupyter Notebook file, which is the main file for a project. There you can find instructions for each assignment along with my solution.

Reviews I got for these projects can be found in the `reviews` folder.
